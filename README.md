Analysis of variables nbp, tas, gpp, ra and rh from CMIP6 Earth System Models

Data Analysis:
Making use of the latest ESM projections of CMIP6, the thesis analyzes the impacts of future high and low emission scenarios (SSP1.1-9, SSP2-4.5, SSP5-8.5) on the natural land carbon sinks by exploring global and regional trends. 
It further examines the future land carbon sink responses when reaching the Paris Agreement temperature targets of 1.5°C and 2.0°C global mean warming under high and low emission scenarios, as well as verifying if there is a potential pathway dependence. Thereby, the following hypothesis is examined: If carbon sinks are pathway independent, at each temperature level (1.5°C and 2.0°C, respectively), almost the same spatial distribution for land carbon sinks should occur for the three scenarios. This hypothesis is established for the following reasons: (i) the same global mean temperature for each scenario is considered (either 1.5°C or 2.0°C temperature level); (ii) regional distribution of surface air temperature change displays nearly the same pattern of regional temperature change in all three scenarios for each level of warming (either 1.5°C or 2.0°C). If the hypothesis of pathway independence is confirmed, it would lead to the conclusion that it would be indifferent which pathway humanity will take before stabilizing global mean temperature at 1.5°C or 2.0°C, respectively, since all studied scenarios would lead to the same spatial distribution of future land carbon sinks when reaching the Paris Agreement targets.
